    The dataset must be declared as a (balanced) panel using tsset.  Variables specified in <i>depvar</i> and <i>predictorvars</i> must be
    numeric variables; abbreviations are not allowed. The command <span class=result>synth</span> (available in SSC) is required.  Auxiliary commands
    for generating graphs post-estimation are shown in the examples below.  Finally, the version of the package can be found
    by running <span class=result>synth_runner version</span> and checking <span class=result>r(version)</span> or viewing the displayed output.
<br><br>
<br><br>
<span class=result><u>Description</u></span>
<br><br>
    <span class=result>synth_runner</span> automates the process of running multiple synthetic control estimations by <span class=result>synth</span>. It will run placebo
    estimates in-space (estimations for the same treatment period but on all the control units).  It will then provide
    inference (p-values) comparing the estimated main effect to the distribution of placebo effects. It handles the case where
    several units receive treatment, possibly at different time periods.  If there are multiple treatment periods, then
    effects are centered around the treatment period so as to be comparable.  The maximum common number of leads and lags that
    can be achieved in the data given the treated units are used for analysis.  It provides facilities for automatically
    generating outcome predictors using a training proportion of the pre-treatment period. It also provides diagnostics to
    assess fit.  <span class=result>synth_runner</span> is designed to accompany <span class=result>synth</span> but not to supersede it.  For more details about single
    estimations (variable weights, observation weights, covariate balance, and synthetic control outcomes when there are
    multiple time periods) use <span class=result>synth</span> directly.  See <i>synth</i> and Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003) and Abadie, Diamond, and
    Hainmueller (2010, 2014) for more details.
<br><br>
<span class=result><u>Required Settings</u></span>
<br><br>
<a name="predoptions"></a>    <span class=result>depvar</span> the outcome variable.
<br><br>
    <span class=result>predictorvars</span> the list of predictor variables. See <i>synth</i> for more details.
<br><br>
  For specifying the unit and time-period of treatment, there are two methods. Exactly one of these is required.
<br><br>
    <span class=result>trunit(</span><i>#</i><span class=result>)</span> and <span class=result>trperiod(</span><i>#</i><span class=result>)</span>. This syntax (used by <span class=result>synth</span>) can be used when there is a single unit entering treatment.  Since
        synthetic control methods split time into pre-treatment and treated periods, <span class=result>trperiod</span> is the first of the treated
        periods and, slightly confusingly, also called post-treatment.
<br><br>
    <span class=result>d(</span>varname<span class=result>)</span>. The <span class=result>d</span> variable should be a binary variable which is 1 for treated units in treated periods, and 0 everywhere
        else.  This allows for multiple units to undergo treatment, possibly at different times.
<br><br>
<span class=result><u>Options</u></span>
<br><br>
    <span class=result>trends</span> will force <span class=result>synth</span> to match on the trends in the outcome variable. It does this by scaling each unit's outcome
        variable so that it is 1 in the last pre-treatment period.
<br><br>
    <span class=result>pre_limit_mult(</span><i>real&gt;=1</i><span class=result>)</span> will not include placebo effects in the pool for inference if the match quality of that control,
        pre-treatment Root Mean Squared Predictive Error (RMSPE), is greater than <i>pre_limit_mult</i> times the match quality of
        the treated unit.
<br><br>
    <span class=result>training_propr(</span>0&lt;=<i>real</i>&lt;=1<span class=result>)</span> instructs <span class=result>synth_runner</span> to automatically generate the outcome predictors. The default (0) is to
        not generate any (the user then includes the desired ones in predictorvars).  If set to a number greater than 0, then
        that initial proportion of the pre-treatment period is used as a training period with the rest being the validation
        period.  Outcome predictors for every time in the training period will be added to the <span class=result>synth</span> commands. Diagnostics of
        the fit for the validation period will be outputted.  If the value is between 0 and 1, there will be at least one
        training period and at least one validation period.  If it is set to 1, then all the pre-treatment period outcome
        variables will be used as predictors. This will make other covariate predictors redundant.
<br><br>
    <span class=result>ci</span> outputs confidence intervals from randomization inference for raw effect estimates. These should only be used if the
        treatment is randomly assigned (conditional on covariates and interactive fixed-effects).  If treatment is not
        randomly assigned then these confidence intervals do not have a straight-forward interpretation (in contrast to
        p-values which do).
<br><br>
    <span class=result>pvals1s</span> outputs one-sided p-values in addition to the two-sided p-values.
<br><br>
    <span class=result>gen_vars</span> generates variables in the dataset from estimation.  This is only allowed if there is a single period in which
        unit(s) enter treatment. If <span class=result>gen_vars</span> is specified, it will generate the following variables:
<br><br>
        <span class=result>lead:</span>
            A variable that contains the respective time period relative to treatment. <i>Lead=1</i> specifies the first
            period of treatment. This is to match Cavallo et al. (2013) and in effect is the offset from the last
            non-treatment period.
<br><br>
        <i>depvar</i><span class=result>_synth:</span>
            A variable that contains the unit's synthetic control outcome for that time period.
<br><br>
        <span class=result>effect:</span>
            A variable that contains the difference between the unit's outcome and its synthetic control for that
            time period.
<br><br>
        <span class=result>pre_rmspe:</span>
            A variable, constant for a unit, containing the pre-treatment match quality in terms of RMSPE.
<br><br>
        <span class=result>post_rmspe:</span>
            A variable, constant for a unit, containing a measure of the post-treatment effect (jointly over all
            post-treatment time periods) in terms of RMSPE.
<br><br>
        <i>depvar</i><span class=result>_scaled:</span>
            If the match was done on trends, this is the unit's outcome variable normalized so that its last
            pre-treatment period outcome is 1.
<br><br>
        <i>depvar</i><span class=result>_scaled_synth:</span>
            If the match was done on trends, this is the unit's synthetic control's (scaled) outcome variable.
<br><br>
        <span class=result>effect_scaled:</span>
            If the match was done on trends, this is the difference between the unit's (scaled) outcome and its
            (scaled) synthetic control for that time period.
<br><br>
    <span class=result>n_pl_avgs(</span><i>string</i><span class=result>)</span> controls the number of placebo averages to compute for inference. The total possible grows exponentially
        with the number of treated events.  If omitted, the default behavior is cap the number of averages computed at
        1,000,000 and if the total is more than that to sample (with replacement) the full distribution.  The option
        <span class=result>n_pl_avgs(</span><i>all</i><span class=result>)</span> can be used to override this behavior and compute all the possible averages.  The option<span class=result> n_pl_avgs(</span><i>#</i><span class=result>)</span>
        can be used to specify a specific number less than the total number of averages possible.
<br><br>
    <span class=result>max_lead(</span><i>int</i><span class=result>)</span> will limit the number of post-treatment periods analyzed. The default is the maximum number of leads that is
        available for all treatment periods.
<br><br>
    <span class=result>noenforce_const_pre_length</span> - When there are multiple periods, estimations at later treatment dates will have more
        pre-treatment history available.  By default, these histories are trimmed on the early side so that all estimations
        have the same amount of history.  If instead, maximal histories are desired at each estimation stage, use
        <span class=result>noenforce_const_pre_length</span>.
<br><br>
    <span class=result>parallel</span> will enable parallel processing if the <span class=result>parallel</span> command is installed and configured. Version 1.18.2 is needed at
        a minimum (available via https://github.com/gvegayon/parallel/).
<br><br>
    <span class=result>deterministicoutput</span> eliminates displayed output that would vary depending on the machine (e.g. timers and number of
        parallel clusters) so that log files can be easily compared across runs.
<br><br>
    <span class=result>pred_prog(</span><i>string</i><span class=result>)</span> is a method to allow time-contingent predictor sets.  The user writes a program that takes as input a
        time period and outputs via <span class=result>r(predictors)</span> a <span class=result>synth</span>-style predictor string.  If one is not using <span class=result>training_propr</span> then
        <span class=result>pred_program</span> could be used to dynamically include outcome predictors. See Example 3 for usage details.
<br><br>
    <span class=result>drop_units_prog(</span><i>string</i><span class=result>)</span> is the name of a program that, when passed the unit to be considered treated, will drop other
        units that should not be considered when forming the synthetic control.  Commonly this is because they are neighboring
        or interfering units. See Example 3 for usage details.
<br><br>
    <span class=result>xperiod_prog(</span><i>string</i><span class=result>)</span> allows for setting of <span class=result>synth</span>'s <span class=result>xperiod</span> option that varies with the treatment period.  The user-written
        program is passed the treatment period and should return, via <span class=result>r(xperiod)</span>, a numlist suitable for <span class=result>synth</span>'s <span class=result>xperiod</span> (the
        period over which generic predictor variables are averaged).  See <span class=result>synth</span> for more details on the <span class=result>xperiod</span> option. See
        Example 3 for usage details.
<br><br>
    <span class=result>mspeperiod_prog(</span><i>string</i><span class=result>)</span> allows for setting of <span class=result>synth</span>'s <span class=result>mspeperiod</span> option that varies with the treatment period.  The
        user-written program is passed the treatment period and should return, via <span class=result>r(mspeperiod)</span>, a numlist suitable for
        <span class=result>synth</span>'s <span class=result>mspeperiod</span> (the period over which the prediction outcome is evaluated).  See <span class=result>synth</span> for more details on the
        <span class=result>mspeperiod</span> option. See Example 3 for usage details.
<br><br>
    <span class=result>synthsettings</span> pass-through options sent to <span class=result>synth</span>. See <i>help synth</i> for more information.  The following which are
        disallowed: <i>counit</i>, <i>figure</i>, <i>resultsperiod</i>.

<br><br>
<span class=result><u>Saved Results</u></span>
<br><br>
    <span class=result>synth_runner</span> returns the following scalars and matrices.
<br><br>
        <span class=result>e(treat_control) :</span>
          A matrix with the average treatment outcome (centered around treatment) and the average of the outcome of those
          unit's synthetic controls for the pre- and post-treatment periods.
<br><br>
        <span class=result>e(b):</span>
          A vector with the per-period effects (unit's actual outcome minus the outcome of its synthetic control) for
          post-treatment periods.
<br><br>
        <span class=result>e(n_pl):</span>
          The number of placebo averages used for comparison. For single treatment setups, this can be used to calculate
          purely randomized p-values.
<br><br>
        <span class=result>e(pvals):</span>
          A vector of the proportions of placebo effects that are at least as large as the main effect for each post-treatment
          period.
<br><br>
        <span class=result>e(pvals_std):</span>
          A vector of the proportions of placebo standardized effects that are at least as large as the main standardized
          effect for each post-treatment period.
<br><br>
        <span class=result>e(pval_joint_post):</span>
          The proportion of placebos that have a post-treatment RMSPE at least as large as the average for the treated units.
<br><br>
        <span class=result>e(pval_joint_post_std):</span>
          The proportion of placebos that have a ratio of post-treatment RMSPE over pre-treatment RMSPE at least as large as
          the average ratio for the treated units.
<br><br>
        <span class=result>e(avg_pre_rmspe_p):</span>
          The proportion of placebos that have a pre-treatment RMSPE at least as large as the average of the treated units. A
          measure of fit. Concerning if significant.
<br><br>
        <span class=result>e(failed_opt_targets):</span>
          Errors when constructing the synthetic controls for non-treated units are handled gracefully. If any are detected
          they will be listed in this matrix.  (Errors when constructing the synthetic control for treated units will abort
          the method.)
<br><br>
        <span class=result>e(avg_val_rmspe_p):</span>
          When specifying <span class=result>training_propr</span>, this is the proportion of placebos that have a RMSPE for the validation period at
          least as large as the average of the treated units. A measure of fit. Concerning if significant.
<br><br>
<br><br>
<span class=result><u>Examples</u></span>
<br><br>
    The following examples use data from the <span class=result>synth</span> package. Ensure that <span class=result>synth</span> was installed with ancillary files (e.g., <span class=result>ssc</span>
    <span class=result>install synth, all</span>). This panel dataset contains information for 39 US States for the years 1970-2000 (see Abadie,
    Diamond, and Hainmueller (2010) for details).
    sysuse smoking
    tsset state year
<br><br>
    Example 1 - Reconstruct the initial <span class=result>synth</span> example plus graphs:
    synth_runner cigsale beer(1984(1)1988) lnincome(1972(1)1988) retprice age15to24 cigsale(1988) cigsale(1980) cigsale(1975),
        trunit(3) trperiod(1989) gen_vars
    single_treatment_graphs, depvar(cigsale) trunit(3) trperiod(1989) trlinediff(-1) effects_ylabels(-30(10)30)
        effects_ymax(35) effects_ymin(-35)
    effect_graphs , depvar(cigsale) depvar_synth(cigsale_synth) trunit(3) trperiod(1989) trlinediff(-1) effect_var(effect)
    pval_graphs
        In this example, <span class=result>synth_runner</span> conducts all the estimations and inference. Since there was only a single treatment
        period we can save the output and merge it back into the dataset. Then we can create the various graphs.  Note the
        option <i>trlinediff</i> allows the offset of a vertical treatment line.  Likely options include values in the range from
        (first treatment period - last post-treatment period) to 0 and the default value is -1 (to match Abadie et al. 2010).
<br><br>
    Example 2 - Same treatment, but a bit more complicated setup:
    gen byte D = (state==3 &amp; year&gt;=1989)
    synth_runner cigsale beer(1984(1)1988) lnincome(1972(1)1988) retprice age15to24, trunit(3) trperiod(1989) trends
        training_propr(`=13/18') gen_vars pre_limit_mult(10)
    single_treatment_graphs, depvar(cigsale_scaled) effect_var(effect_scaled) trunit(3) trperiod(1989)
    effect_graphs , depvar(cigsale_scaled) depvar_synth(cigsale_scaled_synth) effect_var(effect_scaled) trunit(3)
        trperiod(1989)
    pval_graphs
        Again there is a single treatment period, so output can be saved and merged back into the dataset. In this setting we
        (a) specify the treated units/periods with a binary variable, (b) generate the outcome predictors automatically using
        the initial 13 periods of the pre-treatment era (the rest is the "validation" period), and (c) we match on trends.
<br><br>
    Example 3 - Multiple treatments at different time periods:
<br><br>
    cap program drop my_pred my_drop_units my_xperiod my_mspeperiod
    program my_pred, rclass
        args tyear
        return local predictors "beer(`=`tyear'-4'(1)`=`tyear'-1') lnincome(`=`tyear'-4'(1)`=`tyear'-1')"
    end
    program my_drop_units
        args tunit
        if `tunit'==39 qui drop if inlist(state,21,38)
        if `tunit'==3 qui drop if state==21
    end
    program my_xperiod, rclass
        args tyear
        return local xperiod "`=`tyear'-12'(1)`=`tyear'-1'"
    end
    program my_mspeperiod, rclass
        args tyear
        return local mspeperiod "`=`tyear'-12'(1)`=`tyear'-1'"
    end
    gen byte D = (state==3 &amp; year&gt;=1989) | (state==7 &amp; year&gt;=1988)
    synth_runner cigsale retprice age15to24, d(D) pred_prog(my_pred) trends training_propr(`=13/18')
        drop_units_prog(my_drop_units)) xperiod_prog(my_xperiod) mspeperiod_prog(my_mspeperiod)
    effect_graphs , multi depvar(cigsale)
    pval_graphs
        We extend Example 2 by considering a control state now to be treated (Georgia in addition to California). No treatment
        actually happened in Georgia in 1987. Now that we have several treatment periods we can not merge in a simple file.
        Some of the graphs (of <span class=result>single_treatment_graphs</span>) can no longer be made. The option <i>multi</i> is now passed to
        <span class=result>effect_graphs</span>.  We also show how predictors, unit dropping, <span class=result>xperiod</span>, and <span class=result>mspeperiod</span> can be dynamically generated
        depending on the treatment year.
